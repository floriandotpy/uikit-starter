# uikit-starter

A basic starter setup for integrating UIkit in your front-end workflow. This is a suggestion which tools to use and what file-structure to start with. You might want other tools or change the structure according to your project needs.

## Getting started

*Notice:* You need to have [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), [Bower](http://bower.io/) and [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) running on your local system to use the code provided.

1. Download or clone the repository and navigate to the directory on your terminal.

2. Install all JavaScript dependencies required in `package.json` by running:

    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

3. Run Gulp once to compile the LESS to CSS (Gulp tasks defined in `gulpfile.js`):

    ```sh
    gulp
    ```

Done. You can now view `index.html` in your browser and start creating your own project from this foundation.

## Working with the code

To create your own styling for UIkit, start editing `assets/site.less`. If you want to recompile LESS every time you save that file, make sure the following is running in the background:

```sh
gulp watch
```

In the future, you will want to extend what `gulpfile.js` provides. Use `npm` to add any module and make sure to set the `-S` flag to add the dependency to your `package.json`.

```sh
npm install -S <some-module>
```
